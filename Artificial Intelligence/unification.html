</dt><dd>When we write a <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~billw/dictionaries/prolog/goal.html">goal</a> like <code>X = Y</code> in Prolog, we are testing
  for more than simple equality in the mathematical sense. We are testing
  whether <code>X</code> (which might be a <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~billw/dictionaries/prolog/variable.html">variable</a>,
  an <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~billw/dictionaries/prolog/atom.html">atom</a>, or an
  arbitrarily complex <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~billw/dictionaries/prolog/term.html">term</a>) <i>unifies</i> with <code>Y</code> (which might also
  be an atom, a variable, or a term). Two atoms,
  including numeric atoms, unify if they are the same. Two more complex
  terms unify if they have the same <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~billw/dictionaries/prolog/functor.html">functor</a> and their
  corresponding <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~billw/dictionaries/prolog/argument.html">arguments</a> unify. A variable always unifies with a term (provided
  that it is not previously unified with something different) by <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~billw/dictionaries/prolog/binding.html">binding</a>
  to that term. <i>Examples</i>:
  <table border="1">
  <tbody><tr>
  <td>
  <pre>?- fred = fred.
true.
  </pre>
  </td><td><code>fred</code> unifies with <code>fred</code> - they are the same atom.
  </td></tr>

  <tr>
  <td>
  <pre>?- X = fred.
X = fred
  </pre>
  </td><td> <code>X</code> unifies with <code>fred</code> by binding <code>X</code> to <code>fred</code>.
  </td></tr>

  <tr>
  <td>
  <pre>?- X = likes(mary, pizza).
X = likes(mary, pizza).
  </pre>
  </td><td><code>X</code> unifies with <code>likes(mary, pizza) by binding
      <code>X</code> to <code>likes(mary, pizza)</code>.
  </code></td></tr>

  <tr>
  <td>
  <pre>?- likes(
|        mary,
|        book(
|             title(Title),
|             author(
|                    given('Herman'),
|                    SurnameTerm)))
|  =
|  likes(
|        Who,
|        book(
|             title('Moby Dick'),
|             author(
|                    given('Herman'),
|                    surname('Melville')))).
Title = 'Moby Dick',
SurnameTerm = surname('Melville'),
Who = mary.
  </pre>
  </td><td><font color="red">Note that the | characters at the start of each line are continuation prompts
    from Prolog because this query has been spread over more than one line.</font><br>
    <code>Title</code>, <code>SurnameTerm</code>, and <code>Who</code> are bound in order to achieve unification.
    The primary functors of the terms on either side of the <code>=</code> match, and unification proceeds by
    matching pairs of corresponding arguments, for example, by matching and unifying the first argument on the left,
    <code>mary</code>, with the first argument on the right, <code>Who</code>. Unification succeeds if <i>all</i>
    of the arguments match. This will include recursively matching the arguments of substructures such as the
    <code>author/2</code> substructures.

<p>
The goal <code>X \= Y</code> succeeds if <code>X = Y</code> would fail; it
is the negated form of <code>=</code>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Unnecessary Use of "<code>="</code> to Force Unification</b>
</p>
<p>
This is basically a style issue. Consider the two following
alternative pieces of Prolog code for computing the maximum of
two numbers.
</p>
<pre class="code">max1(X, Y, X) :- X &gt; Y.
max1(X, Y, Y) :- X =&lt; Y.
</pre>
versus
<pre class="code">max2(X, Y, Max) :- X &gt; Y, Max = X.
max2(X, Y, Max) :- X =&lt; Y, Max = Y.
</pre>
<p>
The first version is to be preferred, particularly for a novice Prolog
programmer, because it reinforces how Prolog works. It also does not
involve the unnecessary <code>Max = X</code> or <code>Max
= Y</code>.
</p>
<p>
Whenever you write "<code>=</code>" in a Prolog procedure, review the
code to see whether you can get rid of the "<code>=</code>" clause
by replacing the item on the left of "<code>=</code>" by the item to
the right of it, elsewhere in the procedure. If you do this with <code>max2</code>,
you get <code>max1</code>. Sometimes you may have written the "<code>=</code>"
with the variable on the right, in which case you need to instead replace the item
on the right of the "<code>=</code>" with the item to the left of it.
</p>

<p>It should be possible to do this whenever there is a
<a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~billw/dictionaries/prolog/variable.html">variable</a> (rather than a more complex
<a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~billw/dictionaries/prolog/term.html">term</a>) on at least one side of the "<code>=</code>".
