The proposal that I suggested during the tutorial session is to come up with an application on iPhone and Android devices for users that play the latest Fifa 17. These groups into five different categories, which are starters, lottery, coins and building, accessories and recycling. Each category has its own use to provide information, or services, to the customer. Starters would give customers a brief introduction of what the app is all about and what they do. Fifa Lottery (Fifa version) is starting from £1, £10 and £50 ticket. Each ticket has its own prizes. Winning the Fifa Lottery commences at the end of the month on a Friday night and the winner is automatically told on the app if he/she has won. Coins is if the customer wants to purchase FUT (Fifa Ultimate Team) coins. Building is letting the customers play around with football player’s information and building a team around it. Accessories is we selling products based fifa such as headphones, chargers, consoles and others.  Recycling may be seen a bit odd with a fifa app, however it makes sense when this app allows customers to give any unnecessary electronics that they feel they do not use anymore. These electronics can be sent to us and it can be from fifa games to old mobile phones, and of course, there will be something in return. 
The target audience is aimed at anyone whom plays the current fifa. According to Christopher Dring, Fifa 16 sold up to 1M copies. This shows us that the target audience is large and this number is only going to increase by looking at the latest Fifa 17. Gamers will get involved.  However, any gamers that decide to participate and they are below the age of 18; they need someone 18+ to participate in any of the categories named above.
